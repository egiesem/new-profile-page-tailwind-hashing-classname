                  tried to make a discord bot in js, also followed a lot of tutorials, didnt rly know what i was doing <br />
                  tried making another unity incremental game and another discord bot, both turned out a lot better <br />
                  tried to use puppeteer to make a reddit bot but it failed

                  tried to make a website with html, css, and js. thought it was a cool idea. deployed it in github pages. learned basic html and css through that project. <br />
                  after i tried making an incremental game with html css and js, also deployed to github pages, also tried out electronjs but never ported the project to it <br />
                  after tried redesigning it in react. tried heroku cuz github pages would not work well with react learned data fethcing in react <br />
                  tried making a basic rest api in js with express <br />
                  after that i tried making a fullstack app with an api and a react frontend <br />
                  learned nextjs wasnt that hard since its based off react <br />
                  nextjs was much more organized and has ssr which is cool (cool) <br />
                  later tried graphql with apollo-server <br />
                  also tried using mongodb (no mongoose) <br />
                  tried making a small project with nextjs and graphql <br />
                  after i tried making my first serious project (zwav)
                  <br />
                  it used nextjs, apollo-client, tailwind for the frontend and graphql, apollo-server, and mongodb for the backend <br />
                  forgot to mention but i also started using typescript around this time <br />
                  learned some nestjs cuz i thought my backend code was unorganized <br />
                  quit cuz it had a lot of boilerplate, was kinda slow, and the docs pretty much only focused on typegraphql <br />
                  after tried learning go since its a compiled lang which should be fast <br />
                  got kinda bored and went back to js <br />
                  around this time tried puppeteer again to make a reddit and twitter bot <br />
                  got demotivated after the twitter acc got locked out after like 5 logins <br />
                  tried making a cli in js called lotus-create <br />
                  it generates basic hello world project in js or ts <br />
                  stopped working on zwav and started emberwave which is basically zwav but better <br />
                  started using prisma as an orm <br />
                  decided to redesign the profile page again which is what is currently happening
