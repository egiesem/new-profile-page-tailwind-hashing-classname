                <Gr>real attempt</Gr>, it was styled and organized. the frontend used <Gr>nextjs</Gr> with typescript, <Gr>tailwind</Gr> for styling cuz its rly good, its a way more productive to
                style stuff and is less confusing cuz all the style attributes are directly on the element instead of in some random css file, its all a more consistent way to organize css. i used{' '}
                <Gr>apollo-client</Gr> for fetching cuz my backend was using <Gr>graphql</Gr>. my backend stack was <Gr>typescript, nodejs, apollo-server, and mongodb</Gr>. i used{' '}
                <Gr>apollo-server-express</Gr> i had a graphql api on /graphql but i also had rest api on /rest. i didnt use the rest api even tho rest is faster than graphql. graphql fetching is just
                better than rest on the client side. apollo was the only graphql frameworks i knew, no reason there. i used mongodb cuz it was the only database i knew. mongodb is <Gr>nosql</Gr>, so i
                didnt learn sql. i was using <Gr>mongo-client</Gr>, not <Gr>mongoose</Gr> so i didnt have a <Gr>orm</Gr>. later after this project i would start using <Gr>prisma</Gr> which has an orm,
                and also auto generates sql code i think so i might not have to learn sql. anyways the app was a like a social media platform, but worse. you can make posts and after you posted
                something it would refetch posts using react usecontext. there was also endless scrolling, so when u got to the bottom of the page it would fetch more posts. on time it got all 100s on{' '}
                <Gr>lighthouse</Gr>, on no throttle and using next build. it was also <Gr>pwa</Gr> cuz y not. if ur still reading and didnt skip ur a <Gr>chad</Gr>. the app also allowed to comment on
                posts, this helped me understand relations in a database, a comment document should have postId instead of the post document having an array of comments cuz thats bad and mongdb
                documents size are capped at <Gr>16mb</Gr>. the app also allowed you to register and login and had profile pages. i didnt rly know what i was doing with user auth i tried using{' '}
                <Gr>cookies</Gr> and <Gr>jwts</Gr>, in the end it kinda worked but not rly. the register was going to have a bot send you a verification code but the app never got deployed so i never
                bought a domain for the bot email. i worked pretty hard on the app i styled things had cool stuff and used <Gr>twemoji</Gr>. i wanted to be able to have twemojis in the input for when
                ur writing a post or comment but i couldnt figure out how to do that. i also wanted links to be blue in textareas but i couldnt figure out that either. i found a library called{' '}

                this was my first attempt at making a <Gr>cli</Gr> it would use inquirer to ask for some options and generate a basic hello world typescript or javascript project. it allowed you to
                choose ts or js, the project name, the package manager (npm, yarn, pnpm), have nodemon installed, and allowed you to generate a license. i only added the mit license so there werent
                many options there. it also automatically had a <Gr>.gitignore</Gr> file with *.env and node_modules cuz thats something thats kinda annoying to do every time u create a js project. i
                was going to add an option to choose whether to create a new folder and generate the stuff or generate in the current directory but i never did that, it just creates a new folder and
                generates. to use run <Gr>npx lotus-create</Gr> since its on npm, or install it globally <Gr>npm i -g lotus-create</Gr> and run it with <Gr>lotus-create</Gr>

                flag each image took under 1ms to generate. it would generate images in a folder called <Gr>/outputs</Gr> and if it didnt exist it would create one, it allowed you to choose how many
                images to generate which would be like 1.png, 2.png and so on. it also allowed you to specify the starting value (e.g start at 5.png instead of 1.png) and disable or enable logging,
                cuz it logged the attributes of each image when it was generated. it also allowed you to generate a specific image and define the attributes. anyway here are some cool images it

              better discord bot. made this after fBot, when i knew what i was doing, i didnt need to watch any tutorials for this bot. it uses typescript which is good since discordjs docs r kinda
              confusing. it was kinda annoying at first cuz esmodules r different than commonjs but it was worth after setting it up. also prisma works well with ts since it generates types. this bot
              uses mongodb cuz it had a economy system where users could register. it was deployed to heroku, but it could use docker i just didnt find any good places to host it with docker
